# SIMPle: Assessing music similarity using subsequences joins

Welcome to the Similarity Matrix Profile (SiMPle) repository. SiMPle is a tool for assessing music similarity. It is done by (AB- or Self-) join operations. For further information, please check the following papers.

The codes for the different tasks we can perform using SiMPle will be soon available.
